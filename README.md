## LED Blink/Connecting to Github

### Lessons

This assignment and began using CircuitPython for the first time. The assignment was to blink an led which required a new library: digitalio. In CircuitPython the LED is not "high" or "low" but "true" or "false".

## Servo with Capacitive Touch

### Lessons

This assignment I continued to learn how to use CircuitPython. The assignment was to code the capacitive touch ability with the metro express with a continuous servo. The library for capacitive touch is touchio, and the libraries required for the servo are pulseio and servo. The servo library had to be downloaded manually onto the metro express. The first major thing that I had problems with was that I was saving the code to a folder not onto the metro. The second thing was that I was not saving the code as main.py which meant it was working.

## Classes, Objects, + Modules

### Lessons Learned
For this assignment I had to figure out how to code the annode RGB LEDs. At first when I did research the adafruit website said they had to be coded using PMW pins (the pulseio library), but I couldn't get that code to work, so I tried just using the digitalio library which worked. I didn't quite understand the logic of the instances at first, so it was useful to match up the logic that I understood of the RGB led with the sample dog code used in the assignment.
